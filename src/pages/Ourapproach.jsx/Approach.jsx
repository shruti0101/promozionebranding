          Depending on the goals and requirements set, we will gather more

          rank locally on search engines or your website design. This helps
          us when we are creating tailored strategies to make sure we get it
          right. Using your business‚Äô website and tools such as Moz and Local
          Viking, we can see what keywords you currently rank for, and other
          long-tail keywords that you could rank for. The data collected is
          used to form the strategy.

                During this stage, we create a functioning prototype using the

                Once the business has access to the prototype, we request

                when we create the final design.
